The quarantine email the user receives instructs them to visit a custom web application only available within our corporate network to then approve their device.  This is in place to provide a pseudo multi-factor experience since the native mobile applications do not support MFA.When a user \"approves\" their device, the custom web application uses Exchange PowerShell Remoting to \"Allow\" the device for the user.  We have been using this approach on premise for quite a few years now and it has been working flawlessly.Now that we are moving to Exchange Online, we have to take care to tightly manage the remote PowerShell connections to Exchange Online because of the connection throttling that Exchange Online has in place to protect the service.It would be great if there was a REST API available to perform these sort of management operations for mobile devices.  Getting PowerShell to work in the context of a web application on the server side has a lot of challenges that need to be overcome.  Not to mention, the process to build up a remote connection to Exchange Online takes 20+ seconds to build up and tear down.  REST API would be a much lighter weight and modern solution to manage things in Exchange Online than PowerShell.We are also aware that the Outlook App for iOS and Android support MFA.  However, until the Outlook App is closer in feature parity to the native application, we are not able to move to the application.  Specifically, contact sync, calendar shortcomings and lack of notes/task sync is what is keeping us from fully adopting the Outlook for iOS and Android app at this point in time.", "author": "127857840", "created_at": "2017-02-22", "votes": 14, "reaction": [], "comments": [{"author": "127857840", "created_at": "2017-02-22", "text": "Also consider adding other mailbox information.

Well, I have around 23,000 objects that are in sync with AAD but the number of changes each day are a handful. Still none of those changes are picked up by AAD Connect unless I perform a full import instead of delta import. To me this explanation is not technically making any sense and sounds like a bug or something in AAD Connect. Again according to her, many organizations are reporting the same issue to Microsoft.

This is especially true if you don't plan to stay in Sweden long-term. But don't let it fall off the radar; follow The Local's guide to manage and maximize your Swedish pension, even if you don't intend to stay here permanently.Image\nIf you're working and paying tax in Sweden, you're probably entitled to a pension. Here's what you need to know. Photo: Simon Paulin/imagebank.sweden.se\nThis article is available to Members of The Local. Read more about membership here.The Swedish pension is part of the country's social insurance system, and it can seem like a confusing beast at times. The good news is that if you're living and working here, you'll almost certainly be earning towards a pension, and you'll be able to get that money even if you move elsewhere before retirement.Exactly how much money goes into your pension pot depends on many factors, including your salary, length of time working in Sweden, your company's policy, and your own personal decisions (especially if you're self-employed). Those who spend only a few years working in Sweden will earn a much smaller pension than people who work here for their whole lives, but that money could come in very useful once you retire, so it's important to know what you'll be entitled to.The easiest way to understand how the Swedish pension works is breaking it down into three parts. There are three different sources for the Swedish pension: the state, your employer, and yourself.If you've worked and paid tax in Sweden, you should be entitled to a Swedish pension. Photo: Simon Paulin/imagebank.sweden.seFirst, there's the state pension (allm√§n pension), which comes from money paid in tax, and makes up the biggest part of most people's total pensions. It falls under the remit of the Pensionsmyndigheten or the Swedish Pensions Agency, a government authority dedicated to, you guessed it, pensions.Absolutely everyone who has worked and paid tax in Sweden is entitled to this pension, and it's split into two parts: an income pension and a premium pension.The income pension (inkomstpension) makes up the bulk of this. Each year, 16 percent of your income is paid into this pension. In this context, 'income' includes wages as well as all other taxable benefits such as paid sickness or parental leave, and unemployment benefits.It's the employer who pays this, as part of the fees associated with employment, so you won't see it deducted from your salary and there's nothing that you as an employee need to do. The higher your salary, the higher the income pension will be, although once you reach the upper limit on pensionable income, your state pension won't increase any further. This upper ceiling was 41,359 kronor per month for the income year 2017, though this amount is regularly adjusted.Keep track of your Swedish pension to be prepared for retirement. Photo: Henrik Montgomery/TTOn top of the income pension, a further 2.5 percent of your income goes into investment funds (the premium pension or 'premiepension'). Again, this is paid by the employer, but if you want to, you can choose which funds your money goes into. If you do not make a choice, your money will be invested in AP7 S√•fa, the Seventh AP Fund (National Generation Management Option) which is the default option.If you do want to move your funds, this can be done as often as you want, for free, by logging into the Swedish Pensions Agency's website using BankID. You can have up to five funds at the same time, and there is a list"}]}

I don't need my phone buzzing every time I get an email.  I have Outlook open on my computer. It just adds to the stress level by over-notification.  Because I'm occasionally away from my desk, I don't want turn the notifications off totally.  I had Touchdown set to sync every 2 hours.  That would give me the ability to reasonably stay ahead of any notification spam on my phone.\nScenario 2: On Vacation where I still want to be 'somewhat' in touch.  I could turn the polling frequency down to 4 hours.\nScenario 3: On vacation, and I don't want to be bothered unless I have the time.

This is especially true if you don't plan to stay in Sweden long-term. But don't let it fall off the radar; follow The Local's guide to manage and maximize your Swedish pension, even if you don't intend to stay here permanently.Image\nIf you're working and paying tax in Sweden, you're probably entitled to a pension. Here's what you need to know. Photo: Simon Paulin/imagebank.sweden.se\nThis article is available to Members of The Local. Read more about membership here.The Swedish pension is part of the country's social insurance system, and it can seem like a confusing beast at times. The good news is that if you're living and working here, you'll almost certainly be earning towards a pension, and you'll be able to get that money even if you move elsewhere before retirement.Exactly how much money goes into your pension pot depends on many factors, including your salary, length of time working in Sweden, your company's policy, and your own personal decisions (especially if you're self-employed). Those who spend only a few years working in Sweden will earn a much smaller pension than people who work here for their whole lives, but that money could come in very useful once you retire, so it's important to know what you'll be entitled to.The easiest way to understand how the Swedish pension works is breaking it down into three parts. There are three different sources for the Swedish pension: the state, your employer, and yourself."}, {"author": "774834322", "created_at": "2018-04-07", "text": "Vb"}]}

This is especially true if you don't plan to stay in Sweden long-term. But don't let it fall off the radar; follow The Local's guide to manage and maximize your Swedish pension, even if you don't intend to stay here permanently.Image\nIf you're working and paying tax in Sweden, you're probably entitled to a pension. Here's what you need to know. Photo: Simon Paulin/imagebank.sweden.se\nThis article is available to Members of The Local. Read more about membership here.The Swedish pension is part of the country's social insurance system, and it can seem like a confusing beast at times. The good news is that if you're living and working here, you'll almost certainly be earning towards a pension, and you'll be able to get that money even if you move elsewhere before retirement.Exactly how much money goes into your pension pot depends on many factors, including your salary, length of time working in Sweden, your company's policy, and your own personal decisions (especially if you're self-employed). Those who spend only a few years working in Sweden will earn a much smaller pension than people who work here for their whole lives, but that money could come in very useful once you retire, so it's important to know what you'll be entitled to.The easiest way to understand how the Swedish pension works is breaking it down into three parts. There are three different sources for the Swedish pension: the state, your employer, and yourself.If you've worked and paid tax in Sweden, you should be entitled to a Swedish pension. Photo: Simon Paulin/imagebank.sweden.seFirst, there's the state pension (allm√§n pension), which comes from money paid in tax, and makes up the biggest part of most people's total pensions. It falls under the remit of the Pensionsmyndigheten or the Swedish Pensions Agency, a government authority dedicated to, you guessed it, pensions.Absolutely everyone who has worked and paid tax in Sweden is entitled to this pension, and it's split into two parts: an income pension and a premium pension.The income pension (inkomstpension) makes up the bulk of this. Each year, 16 percent of your income is paid into this pension. In this context, 'income' includes wages as well as all other taxable benefits such as paid sickness or parental leave, and unemployment benefits.It's the employer who pays this, as part of the fees associated with employment, so you won't see it deducted from your salary and there's nothing that you as an employee need to do. The higher your salary, the higher the income pension will be, although once you reach the upper limit on pensionable income, your state pension won't increase any further. This upper ceiling was 41,359 kronor per month for the income year 2017, though"}]}

It has 8351 characters and the maximum number of characters is 8192. Reduce the size by removing content, such as words or regular expressions, from the rule, or by removing rule conditions, exceptions, or actions.I would be grateful for a solution to these cases so that the end customer of yours can work more efficiently in Office 365.Thank you", "author": "770589412", "created_at": "2018-03-26", "votes": 1, "reaction": [], "comments": []}

There's only a generic image symbol that appears along with the file name.  The file names are just strings of numbers set by our cell phones when we take photos.  Our team needs to be able to scroll through and actually see the images to send or share them with others from their phones while they are out of the office.  Our old WD MyCloud NAS had this function within their app as do other lesser platforms.  I just assumed the SharePoint app would have this capability.  We just migrated all of our data to SharePoint and this is creating a real issue for us.  Also, if you open one image, you can't scroll through the images like you would in windows photo viewer or other photo apps.  You have to open up each file to see what it is, then close it and open the next.  This is extremely slow.  We are not going to reduce the size of images to 50 mega pixels as we have thousands of photos to sift through.  The lowest resolution I can set on my phone's camera makes about 2-3 MB size photos.  Is there something we can do to get this functionality.  Thank you.", "author": "912379804", "created_at": "2019-07-26", "votes": 1, "reaction": [], "comments": []}

For example, each device and sometimes multiple apps within devices will require that the password be changed.  On Apple devices, that I use, running Office 365 apps, and IOS's own apps, I am developing a \"table\" of my own to remind me that: Mail, Outlook, SharePoint, Admin and OneDrive need the new password.  And that I will need to make the same changes on my iPad.  Plus, Windows desktops accessing Office 365 Portal.  The required password changes are a chore and it would be helpful of course if we could limit or control the frequency.  But making it manageable would be helpful.  I find that making the change immediately across all devices lessens the frustration of bumping into an app that needs changing only to discover that I have forgotten the exact password, which in itself could accidentally lead to making another password change.  And of course there may be some password management techniques/apps that I haven't learned about that could simplify the above chore.
