The reason this functionality is important because the default welcome message does not contain enough information to let the users know what this group is about and what will be its usage. The customized welcome message will help organizations to communicate effectively the intended usage of the Group and other relevant information. The customized welcome emails are really helpful for non-technical users. If  Microsoft can not provide this functionality via User Interface at least this functionality should be available via Microsoft Graph API.

The contention seen with these feature when saving to SharePoint online needs to be addressed quickly. System integrators and partners then need to be educated on how to create success for their customers. The following issues can kill your investment and reputation.The introduction of ‘groups’ and ‘OneDrice Sync’ is a great step forward but comes with some serious flaws for SME / Enterprise customers. •\tThe save to 'Groups' feature is only available in OutLook, same function is missing from other applications in the Office suite.•\tThe OutLook ‘Save to Groups’ feature only lets you save a file to the root of the ‘Group’. There is no navigation option to sub-folders for the end users. This is an unacceptable user experience.\n.\n•\tThere is no way for a user to save data to SharePoint team sites using the ‘Save’ functions in Office. The only option is to purchase a 3rd party plug-in product from OneSouceSolutions or Haman.ie. Its a painful bridging solution and requires you to incur additional unplanned investment to solve foundation capability gaps.•\tThe OneDrive for Business SharePoint Sync feature is very promising. Its provide a hook (window) into your tenant Team Sites, once you have visited the site using a browser and clicked 'Sync', however points to consider.o\tUsers will Sync their entire department and Project SharePoint sites down to their laptop. This is the only way for them to access the entire contents of a site from Office applications. This enables them to ‘Save/Open’ documents using the ‘This PC’ option, which takes them into the OneDrive client embedded in Windows Explorer.o\tWe’ve been telling staff for 20 years they must not store files on the C drive. With OneDrive Sync they now download the entire department shared drive and project sites to their laptops in a matter of minutes. The Exec have the broadest access to company data, as a result they sync the largest volumes of data. This immediately raises security concerns for them, regardless of IT explaining all the compensation Microsoft ATP/Win10 controls you’ve implemented to mitigate their concerns.   o\tOneDrive for Business Sync capability needs to have a ‘passive mode’ where it will cache the entire directory structure (metadata) from a site library to the local OneDrive client but not download (sync) the entire data set to the laptop.\n \no\tRetaining the option to Sync selected content locally for off-line use should remain, however after a set time period OneDrive should purge the content from the local client.o\tWhen uploading content using the OneDrive Sync it should remove the original content from the OneDrive client and replace it with the file/folder metadata of the stored content, or purge the content from the OneDrive client similar to the above bullet.•\tThe option to ‘Add a Place –> Add SharePoint Site’ in Office defaults to the tenant root SharePoint site. Your first action as Admin/CIO/CTO must be to ensure you understand this behaviour and get your data access controls in check. The power within MyAnalytics will quickly expose data (crown jewels) that your Exec user base thought to be private. A big issue for HR, M&A, Corporate Strategy departments. It feels like there is contention/overlap between OneDrive Sync and ‘Add a Place –> Add SharePoint Site, where the latter defaults to the root SharePoint site’As someone stated below getting the above User Experience correct is the golden key to a productive, safe and effective customer. I may have no option other than to revert to a traditional file store or alternate cloud storage solution until the contention us addressed. This would be hugely disappointing and undermine our investment in an otherwise remarkable E5 capability.  It will also put at risk a global digital mobile workplace strategy.

There was such a big push to get people onto 365 groups (some of my DG groups getting auto-mangled into broken 365 groups by MS at one point, don't ask…) but clearly 365 groups are designed for tiny groups in tiny organisations only?  I thought this was under development years ago (baffled as I was it was initially missing) but to still find a complete vacuum of information regarding this long-promised long-overdue functionality is incredibly frustrating.I like the functionality of 365 groups and their self-service subscription management etc, but I don't care about their associated service permissions / Yammer etc linking.  If the issue is Microsoft can't work out how to extend the Exchange concept into these different systems can we not just have an option on the group for linking or otherwise with these systems?  I'm sure Yammer's great, but if it being linked to a 365 group prevents me doing 'normal' things to that group it's making a simple task complex to preserve functionality I’m not using and am not interested with.Please, please please can we have an update on Office 365 group nesting.  Is it getting closer to release or is it something that's found its way to the long grass due to an irreconcilable incompatibility where it's going to stay?Having to manually add every single member to a 365 group is an absolute time pit when you've got all the Departmental (for example) groups set up already and just want to add whole departments quickly and easily (not to mention without error).  As and when a new person joins a department, working group, team or whatever it is (the main vision/purpose of a 365 group as far as I was told) you've got to add them both to that department and to all the teams that department participates in.  This isn't just a doubling of work and propensity for error, it's an exponential increase.  365 Groups as it stands are not viable for large memberships or large organisations, without 3rd party tools or scripts anyway.If we can't add groups to other groups in such an established 'normal' way (and Microsoft expect people to continue to move their currently manageable groups onto these unmanageable ones) then we need some way of automating the management of these giant flat lists.  Give us a way to  more easily bulk-add/bulk-remove lists of members by their other memberships/tags/custom fields etc, even if they are subsequently converted/flattened to unwieldly flat lists of individual members on the back end when you commit.  And I mean a graphical out-of-the-box way; like it or not, not everyone that finds themselves responsible for an email system knows PowerShell… let alone possesses an inclination or the time to learn it just to be able to do things they considered normal before.Nesting groups is something you've been able to do on every mail server since forever, why do I have to choose between sensible and logical (read 'normal') management of groups and the additional benefits of 365 Groups?  I seem to remember at every turn 365 was railroading me into creating everything as a 365 group and being told it would be the only option eventually anyway. Certainly during the repair of our botched auto-migration to 365 Groups (not customer initiated either, to be clear) we were told that the move to 365 groups was inevitable anyway and other group types were to be deprecated in the not too distant future.  Have they now dumped this idea and will now confirm the continuation of manageable DLs?It used to be possible to manage Exchange fairly easily out of the box without buying extra features or 3rd party tools, why does 365 need to railroad you onto such a hampered, unmanageable and seemingly incomplete feature?Please let us know when modern groups will support such basic and established methods of management, or at least a functional equivalent.Kind regards,\nOscar"}, {"author": "745134268", "created_at": "2018-01-24", "text": "We are looking for  subgroup feature soon as part of o365, We need to add members to subgroups and add events "}, {"author": "744362080", "created_at": "2018-01-23", "text": "Adding to the vote count and a comment to hopefully get this out of \"tell us more\" and into action.

Without nested groups we must build a massive code base to maintain a flattened group structure.O365 applications such as Yammer, O365 Groups, Sharepoint Online, Forms, PowerBI all either don’t support nested groups at all or do so quite inconsistently.  Application of permissions in Sharepoint online or support for delegation for resource and equipment mailboxes in Exchange online are further examples.Every other enterprise customer we have spoken to is affected by this lack of functionality and are all in the process of either buying additional third party tools or software development in response."}, {"author": "292460539", "created_at": "2017-04-28", "text": "I assume the goal here would be to allow Office 365 Groups to be placed inside other Office 365 Groups similar to how Distribution Lists can be nested in Exchange.

Too many half-baked features that all try to address similar actual use cases pleases no one.Shared Mailboxes are somewhat obsolete. If you need a  or  shared mailbox, an Office 365 group will work and will likely offer more overall value. Consider creating the Group by creating a Team in Microsoft Teams named 'info' or 'support' (you can give it a nicer name after you create it, the initial name from the Teams App is also used as the Alias. If you use PowerShell to create the Team you can specify the Alias and Names separately. Point being, though, you will bring all the details around this topic into a single place. Your support email and support documents can all be stored nicely together in the same group. The Group resources like Calendar are there too.Groups are accessible from Outlook on Mobile or the Groups app.I think Microsoft should fully commit to replacing Shared Mailboxes with Groups and allow Groups to work in the same way.THE BIG MISSING PIECE OF THE PUZZEL:Right now, there's an extra step, which requires significant user discipline to use a Group to replace a Shared Mailbox...Users must manually replace the 'from' address, which is not even shown by default, when sending to external users 'As' or 'On Behalf of' a group. This field is not available in Outlook on Mobile at all, users on mobile will need to use OWA which requires an extra step each time to show, and then remove, the From address.Training users to do this is difficult and they frequently forget.In our organisation we have locked this down using Transport Rules which reject mail sent outside the organisation using user addresses instead of group addresses, but this is by no means ideal.Microsoft should enable us to force all external mail sent using the group to be send either 'As' or 'On Behalf of' the group.

When I veiw the O365 Calendar and my calendar on OWA, I see 4 of the SAME invite as it is duplicated in both my personal calendar and the O365 calendar (I'd expect to see 2-one in each calendar).The issue isn't that the Group B members are getting the invite, the issue is that the invite is being duplicated and re-sent to EVERYONE on the invite.", "author": "423372706", "created_at": "2017-07-26", "votes": 17, "reaction": [], "comments": []}

And why would they, it’s not their problem.Putting SFB aside the main and more pressing issue is the lack of external organisation collaboration services. They simply don’t exist apart from some archaïque methods that can be achieved in-house without and expense. YES, Office 365 is great if you are a large organisation and the majority of people you are in contact with or at least need to collaborate with are in-house but the reality is that that type of organisation is a small percentage and most organisations need to collaborate with external organisations for the majority of projects.I figured that Microsoft would have at this stage been able to develop a system that allows any Organisation on Office 365 to link to any other Organisation on Office 365 with admin approval. This way smaller organisations would find some use in and justify the expense of using Office 365. The reality is that it makes more sense for me to setup contacts in external organisations on my Office 365 package than my own employees. At least my own employees sit beside me and I chat with them, probably too much chatting. But is it safe to put contacts from external organisations on my Office 365 package, setting up email addresses for them under mycompanyname.com domain and making them members of Office 365 Groups? Wouldn't it make more sense to link organisations?Thanks for reading my rank/feedback.\n", "author": "163616163", "created_at": "2016-04-30", "votes": 6, "reaction": [], "comments": [{"author": "184840047", "created_at": "2016-07-01", "text": "here here\n"}]}

For example, a global company with offices around the world might want to set up external networks but still have access to corporate OneDrive or SharePoint libraries to share content and collaborate across the company. Without connected groups integration in external networks, content becomes siloed in these networks. Enabling O365 connected groups is a substantial improvement to Yammer, however organizations using external networks are not receiving this benefit.

Talking with sales confirmed that they believe all the features of CloudPbx (including fundamental features like call forwarding) should be available with a combination of E1 and CloudPbx & PSTN add-ons.   However, if you don't have full Office versions installed under E3 or higher then you don't actually get these simple PBX features because E1 only incluldes SFB basic version.   Tech supports answer was we needed the Skype for Business Full version and we only paid for the CloudPbx service, not the software that would let us use it.  Why would anyone buy the add-on if the simpleset PBX features can't be used?   It's a ridculous answer and position for tech support to take.At the very lest you need sales and tech support to have the same answers.  If tech support is correct then you need to change your sales literature and make it clear that CloudPbx add-on only comes with a crippled version of Skype for Business that won't let you use fundamental PBX features.I think the proper answer here is to simply include a SFB full version install when the Cloud PBX/PSTN add-ons are purchased, regardless of whether or not a local Office install is there.  That way, small customers who only want the online office apps, but still want to use SFB for a phone solution can do so.I've been told by Sales, but have not confirmed it, that SFB Plan 2 does include the full version of SFB.   If this is true then solving the problem could just be a matter of including the same license to deliver SFB with the CloudPbx/PSTN add-ons.

My name is Dallon, and I'll be helping you out today :)\nDallon H, 08:48 AM\nCase 1432795366--why is my Office 365 still not fixed?\n08:49 AM\nLet me look at your case real quick :)\nDallon H, 08:49 AM\nLooks like you were waiting for an update, yeah?\nDallon H, 08:52 AM\nyes, why can't you guys fix the printing problem right NOW?\n08:52 AM\nI understand this is super frustrating Melvin, give me a few minutes to look into it further since I want to make sure I fully understand the situation\nDallon H, 08:55 AM\nOK--I don't want to have to rehash it again for the *** number of times\n08:55 AM\nI completely understand I know this can be frustrating. I looked over your past cases, and this seems to be a bigger issue that our engineers are working tirelessly on to get that patch out sometime within the next month. I hate to say that since I do not have certainty to when that would be, but I have been told that the update should be out by the end of the month.\nDallon H, 08:59 AM\nAnother thing, I do have this link for you if you would like to fill this out since it will go directly to the engineers \nDallon H, 09:00 AM\nOnce again I do not they are working as hard as they can on this fix since it is a bigger issue right now and we want it gone as soon as possible\nDallon H, 09:00 AM\nThat is NOT acceptable--are you folks knowingly selling DEFECTIVE Office365 Products--it must be if you cannot fix my defect right now, it means that every Office365 sale since I got mine is not working. I feel like I am being lied to in hopes I will go away. If I don't get some straight answers I will file a defective product complaint with the FTC\n09:02 AM\n09:02 AM\nI really do apologize Melvin, this is a very frustrating and hard issue and I really hate that I can't give you a better answer at this time. With the engineers, they normally don't have a set schedule of when they're going to release the fixes because these things require messing around with the code of the product to release the fix. With the timeframe, they're normally pretty accurate so I would say to expect a fix within the next month but if it's a more complicated issue like this one seems to be, it might take more time unfortunately to find a complete fix. We are trying to be as transparent with you about the fixes and the updates as we can be and we never want to feel like we are lying to you, and I truly apologize if you feel that we are doing that. The issue is that we are just as in the dark as you are about the release of the update, so we can only speculate and give general answers like you've been getting previously\nDallon H, 09:07 AM\nWe always appreciate your feedback and again, I want to apologize for making you feel as though this issue is on the backburner. Since we don't have a fix for this, we don't want to waste your time on chats because we don't have any more troubleshooting that will fix the issue so we want to let you get on with your day rather than being stuck with us on a chat that's not going to help the issue.\nDallon H, 09:09 AM\nTo confirm then--all of the Office 365 sales from early July are not printing correctly and are defective--right.\n09:09 AM\nPowere09:09 AM\nNot all of them are having this issue, but there is a large enough group of people that are having similar or the same issues so Microsoft engineers are working on an update to cover this issue and get it fixed. Since there is such a large population using the Office products, we can't confirm that everyone is having this issue because people use the products differently and have different software and printers, etc that could also be causing some problems. I'm not trying to pass this off because this is definitely something that is on Microsoft to fix, but we are working to find a fix for this or a workaround, but we just don't have that information as of now unfortunately\nDallon H, 09:12 AM\nOK, thank you for confirming that Microsoft is knowingly selling a defective product.\n09:14 AM\nWith software, things are ever changing and there are many moving parts. Microsoft's intention is not to sell a defective product because for many people, the software is working perfectly. This issue is part of a minority of products that are having trouble and it is in the process of being fixed - hopefully in the very near future. Again, I'm really sorry that this is happening to you, and I wish there was more I could do to help at this time. If you would like, I'd love to extend your subscription further to account for this usage issue, if you would be interested? I'm very sorry but this is the only thing I am able to offer at this time, other than submitting a ticket to that link I gave you earlier and hoping that the update will be released shortly!\nDallon H, 09:17 AM\nThis doesn't make sense as well--if there are versions that are working properly--why can't you swap out my defective version and install one that's actually working? Including, all the work that needed to be done migrating data and Outlook which took forever.\n09:19 AM\n09:19 AM\nI'll try to clarify. The product uses all the same code across the board, but it causes some issues on individual cases on how customers are using the product. With the ones that are working properly, they might not be using the product as you are in this instance or they might not have the same other software, printer, etc that are pulling data from the Office products so they're not having the same issues that this specific instance is. With customers trying to use the Office products in the same way as you, they seem to be having some trouble with that specific function, which is where the issue comes from. Not everybody uses that function in the same way as you, so not everybody has issues, and while all the products are the \"same\", it depends on usage of the product and whether or not it will work\nDallon H, 09:22 AM\nOK, thanks for some added clarification--but printing landscape would not seem to be all that special or rare. To make matters worse, your tech guys went into my computer and tried to fool the applications--this TOTALLY screwed everything and now I can't print straight in Portrait--how's that for a royal mess up. This is what your guys left me with going on almost a month now. I have been reduced to printing on my old Window7/Office 2007 machine that works perfectly fine. Needless to say I am furious about this mess piled upon mess. I will be ending our chat now and going to the link you provided.\n09:27 AM\n09:27 AM\nOf course, again I'm very sorry about this whole mess, I'm sure it's incredibly frustrating and I hope that we get a fix for this for you ASAP. If you'd like, I could set up another callback with Tier 2 to see if they can correct the mistake that they started earlier, but it's completely up to you and I'm here to help as much as I'm able. I'm glad that you have the other machine to work from in the meantime and I just want to get you the best help available for right now. I truly apologize that this has been such a terrible experience and I hope that we can make up for this in the future through the fix and any support you may need in the future on any other issues you may have. I wish you luck in this issue and if you ever need any more assistance, always feel free to come in and chat with us again - we're here for you and don't forget that! Is there anything else I can do for you while you're here?\nDallon H, 09:30 AM\nI will have to think about doing another Tier 2 call--I wasted more than 6 HOURS with them before they even acknowledged there was a Build 008 problem and then proceeded to mess around with my settings (not telling me what they were doing), doing downloads, and then leaving me with a mess that was WORSE than when it started. I don't know if I can stomach that a third time--after repeatedly telling them is a Office365 software problem and nothing to do with my printer, printer driver, or installation procedure!

Instead, this is stored as a 48 hour event.  The UI is actually setting a \"First Date\" and \"Last Date\" of the all day event, not a \"Start Time\" and \"End Time\".  Just change the wording and remove the time selectors instead of graying out the and locking the time selectors when the \"All day event\" checkbox is ticked. The original comment above is the most glaring symptom of this.  In my above example, the calendar event itself, when opened, will show an End time of \"2/11/2019 12:00 AM\".  If you mouse over the event in your calendar, however, it will show you \"2/12/2019 12:00 AM\".  This display bug is obviously wrong.  n != n+1That said, if the all day event creation dialog UI, which is the same as the event edit/view UI,  reflected the underlying functionality, there would be no problem.

This deleted all of the data and link to that team and it no longer shows up in the Teams app.  I had a support representative from Microsoft walk me through a few PowerShell Scripts in attempt to recover the lost data with no avail.  So, what went wrong?  Well, our tech was trying to add a distribution group to another distribution group and thought he selected a distribution group but instead selected the Office 365 Group (associated with the team) and deleted it.  This should not happen.  Maybe I misunderstand the overall architecture here, but Teams is a totally separate product that is intended to be an instant messaging and collaboration system for teams to communicate with one another.  Why in the world it creates a simple Office 365 Group is beyond me.  Now, what do I want changed?  I want one of two things:1) Hide any Office 365 Group associated with Microsoft Teams so that someone can't delete it from there.  The action of deleting a team should be in the Microsoft Teams application, not the O365 Admin Center.or 2) Change the type of group created to something easily identifiable to the user so that they don't accidentally delete it.  In our case, make it something like Office 365 Teams Group or something similar.Seriously, our team lost a little over a year's worth of data due to this simple mistake of identification due to the fact that Microsoft designed this half-*** Teams product.
