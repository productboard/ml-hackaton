We’ve added details to Message Trace that weren’t there before, decreasing the need to run Historical Searches inside of 7 days.  For Historical Search, we have improved the results to be more clear for those who are not familiar with the Exchange Message Tracking log format.  Additionally, while we get the total value of Message Trace, we’ve also prioritized reducing the constant need to search & destroy.  We’ve made tremendous strides in effectiveness, even as the bad guys got more creative and aggressive.

These are critical tools which must be utilized in order to best protect the interests of our citizens regardless of population size or budget considerations.I ask that Microsoft understand that Government tenants in Azure must have these tools as a matter of course and not as an optional add-on.I'll leave you with this:After the fiasco with the 737 MAX, Boeing will now include ALL safety features as standard with each new aircraft they deliver.What kind of disaster will it take for Microsoft to similarly realize that the EMS licenses/tools are also just as necessary and fundamental? We (your Government) protect critical infrastructure, provide public safety services, and in some cases utilities.

If junk mail senders share the same SMTP servers as a company like FreshDesk it makes sense for the system to tag those servers as bulk.  But what doesn't make sense is to stop there.

You are not listed for spamming or for anything you have done. The PBL is simply a list of all of the world's dynamic IP space, i.e: IP ranges normally assigned by ISPs to broadband customers routers/modems (DSL, DHCP, PPP, cable, dialup). It is perfectly normal for these IP addresses to be listed on the PBL. In fact all dynamic IP addresses in the world should be on the PBL. Even static IPs which do not send mail should be listed in the PBL. MS is blocking mail from all IPs on the list, EVEN WHEN THEY'RE AUTHENTICATED. Note: you can authenticate is other ways than with a username and password. This effectively kills either the effectiveness of the PBL of listing all non-mail servers in the world (as we need to de-list ourselves) or the ability of users to connect alternative devices to O365:\nUsers may have many devices located on the internet that need to send email through O365, including but not limited to MFCs, Webservers, Storage devices, CCTV Cameras, Firewalls, Routers, etc. MS gives 3 ways of connecting these to O365:\na) Create an account on O365: This can get very expensive if the content of each device's emails needs to be partitioned between different departments.

Certainly you could place that server in the cloud, but then you need yet another Azure cloud subscription.

If Safe Links will actually follow the link first after the user clicks it, then we'd see it in our online phishing portal and giving us accurate scores.  If Safe Links just checks it against a \"known bad\" list, then even if the user clicks the url in the phishing email it will never show up in our phishing portal.

After the user goes to search function he will be able to only alter the search query as per the users needs.\nThat would not only make Ediscovery better, that will also make everyone rely more on Office365 services and move out from third party services for archiving. Whats the point to use cloud when you have to keep PST`s archived onprem and pay for all the tin. \nI think ediscovery would be a perfect tool if we would have these functions.RegardsJustin Miskinis - GTR IT", "author": "280507060", "created_at": "2016-11-10", "votes": 23, "reaction": [], "comments": [{"author": "846991708", "created_at": "2018-12-14", "text": "agreed.  I feel this is a rather major oversight.

So either they have to scroll through loads of content or I have to make the search term so specific that I might as well just do everything for them.\n2 - a user with \"eDiscovery manager\" role, can search for any content with any office 365 service, from any user with the organisation! \nIn my opinion this is all or nothing.

I don't want to have to know where emails, chats, etc. are stored; they should just be archived. We should not have to ensure that each mailbox individually has in-place hold enabled, especially as new users are added.  We should not have to write a powershell script for that.

This is a HUGE security hole that can compromise networks very easily. We currently use the Barracuda archiver. It serves as many roles. It's used for journaling mail, it's uses as an end user archiver where users can search and restore deleted mail, and it also serves as a tool for e-discovery.Prior to moving to Office 365 and EOP, all our mail was first filtered by a 3rd party email appliance before reaching Exchange. This ensured that only mail that past all filtering would be journalled. Now that we are in a hybrid configuration and using EOP, all mail, including spam and unwanted mail/malware/phishing items are being journalled because it's done before any filtering.Because of this, users who are searching their archive, are now seeing ALL the unwanted emails that were not previously being sent to the archiver. Furthermore, they have the ability to restore the email to their inbox and be a victim to a phishing or ransomware attack! Furthermore, the amount of store needed has increased 10x or more!This needs to change. Journaling rules should only be applied AFTER all filtering has been completed or if an email is released from the quarantine.Thank you for listening.\nMike\n"}]}

This is a problem, since that value does not reflect very well the amount of activity in any given team, nor the amount of data it contains. \nThus, my suggestion would be that you somehow reconfigure either the rention policy concerning teams - or the MFA itself, so that the size of a Team is calculated in a meaningful manner. \nFor instance, I'm the owner of a rather old team with quite a bit of user activity (loads of channel messages, some containing images and GIFs), a few files uploaded to the doc. library, etc.; which is still below 10mb in \"totalitemsize\".There are other mailbox statistics which might be useful in calculating a more accurate and useful team size, such as \"attachmenttabletotalsize\" and \"bigfunnelindexedsize\".", "author": "896402929", "created_at": "2019-04-24", "votes": 6, "reaction": [], "comments": []}

In-order to do proper analysis we need more \"meat\" out of your current logs via API so we can import this log data into our SIEM environment. I'm ultimately trying to help Microsoft out and here's how.. If I had all aspects of a logfile for an incoming email (External or Internal), I can compare the emails that are slipping past EOP and ATP but are being caught by [vendor name] by keying off of the messageID and comparing the log line from Microsoft that states \"This (email|attachment|link) went through EOP (and/or ATP) and is deemed free of malware\" in comparison with the log line from our current 3rd party vendor we use for email protection that states \"Hey, this email attachment contains malware and here is everything you need to know for why we deemed this as malware.\" I then export the malware links that were missed by Microsoft and submit them through the proper process. Which not only helps you, Microsoft, but other companies that utilize your ATP engine. This is crucial to us and I really hope this gets looked at by someone from Microsoft.Last note: \nPlease quit trying to force Security & Compliance Center Console AND Log Analytics down my throat.. 89 of the Fortune 100 Companies have Splunk in their environment.

The development team should be made aware of this vulnerability and possibly modify the subscribed messages policy and allow us the ability to change the priority and apply domain wide rules when needed for such scenarios.Workaround: Created a local rule to redirect messages from spam sender's address and move it to junk or deleted folder.Any ideas or solutions are greatly appreciated.Thank you.TS", "author": "111257493", "created_at": "2015-10-15", "votes": 5, "reaction": [], "comments": []}

There does not seem to be a reliable way to specify more than one display name to protect for an e-mail address, currently, in spite of the documentation indicating that it should function. Here's what we've seen:- GUI\n  - Log into Security and Compliance center\n  - Create Anti-Phishing policy named \"APPolicy 1\" with requisite settings\n  - Add a user to protect - Jen Public, \n  - Add a second user to protect - Jennifer Public, \nAt this point the GUI updates and has only one user to protect, Jennifer Public, . It has overwritten the first entry. It doesn't throw a warning or error, and there is no description about only being able to protect one display name for a given e-mail. And of course, that's because you *can* have more than one display name, you just have to do it via Powershell. And, before you suggest, we verified that O365 ATP did not flag Jen Public when we impersonated her.- Powershell\n  - Log into EOL powershell\n  - Create or modify (new- or set-, I'll use set- here) ATP policy with two display names at the same e-mail address\n  - Set-AntiPhishPolicy -identity \"APPolicy 1\" -TargetedUsersToProtect \"Jen Public;\",\"Jennifer Public;\"\n  - Ran Get-AntiPhishPolicy and verified both users were there, ran tests, and confirmed that both names were protected.\n- GUI\n  - Logged back into the “APPolicy 1” policy in the security and compliance center - it only shows one user to protect, Jennifer Public, \n  - Added a second user, Jennifer Public, \n  - Saved policy\n- Powershell\n  - Ran Get-AntiPhishPolicy – it showed two protected accounts, Jennifer Public,  and Jennifer Public, It had removed the Jen Public entry – and again without warning of any kind in the GUI.This leaves us without any way to reliably manage multiple display names; if we use Powershell, and someone decides to add a user in the GUI at a later date, it will wipe out any secondary entries for e-mail accounts.

If an end-user blocks an e-mail sender or allows an e-mail sender from within Outlook, the incoming mail from those senders is inserted into the mail flow at the Content Filtering step. From there it goes to either the quarantine or recipient mailbox. I first confirmed this to be happening on blocked messages. I have all my junk mail in our organization going to a system quarantine instead of the junk mail folders for our users to deal with. I wanted to create a mail flow rule that would look at the e-mail header (X-Forefront-Antispam-Report) where it matches ‘SFV:BLK’. I wanted to prepend the subjects in the quarantine, so I could easily scroll through our quarantine and ignore the items my users already do not want (regardless of spam/legitimacy, they intentionally blocked it). The problem is if the user has blocked that sender, the X-headers don't exist on the e-mail yet, or it completely bypasses the mail flow rules. This is because the message does not go through the earlier steps in the EOP (ie: transport rules)! I have mail flow rules that look at the exact same x-header, so I know it should exist at the policy filtering step.On the flip-side of this, a user can bypass the EOP steps by allowing a sender. This is what scares me, and the MS O365 tech support sent me the link to this uservoice site to make sure their 'back-end team' knows about this. If someone sends an e-mail infected with Malware to 2 of our users, 1 that allowed the sender and 1 that did not, both e-mails would take a different route through EOP. The user that doesn't have the allowed sender set up would not receive the message as it would be deleted by connection filtering, anti-malware, or quarantined due to transport rules or the spam filter. The recipient that set the sender on their allow list would receive the message in their inbox without the message passing through the connection filtering, anti-malware, or transport rule policies. This opens up for many potential issues with malware, as well as allowing end-users to override strict transport mail flow policies that may be in place to block certain content, senders, etc. This can be confirmed by the inability to flag allowed sender messages based on the x-headers in the transport rules (ie: SFV:SFE).According to Microsoft tech support and the MS documentation, this is by design. I’m not sure if this was initially configured this way in the back-end as a work-around to allow end-users some control over allow/block of senders in their own mailbox, or if it was just an outdated mail flow model. Hopefully Microsoft will come up with an easy solution (that still allows users to whitelist/blacklist senders) to make sure all mail is sent through all of the EOP steps to ensure the secure delivery of mail that abides by organizational control. Here is Microsoft’s EOP mail flow diagram: .

If the scan detect a suspicious activity, it then warns users, otherwise, the user is redirected to the original link.BaseStriker attack technique leverages the <base> URL tag in the header of an HTML email to split and disguise a malicious link.\n", "author": "786169666", "created_at": "2018-05-11", "votes": 2, "reaction": [], "comments": []}

The reason is that the user has seen the contents of the folder, along with the data of any columns in the folder view. Filenames, subfolder names, and values in columns shown in page views can have sensitive/protected information. As a result, actions that expose them need to be auditable.From a security & auditing point of view, it seems critical to me that these actions be logged. Access to any and all sensitive/protected information needs to be auditable so that organizations can ensure the safety of their data, and prove to stakeholders and regulators that they are properly protecting their data.A support person suggested I post this request here. He said \"After looking into this deeper this looks accurate. Simply clicking on a folder is not a recorded event\". From a product design perspective, tools should let admins make the decision on what is recorded. If there are performance degradations from excessive recording, then make that known so the admin can make an informed decision. But ultimately, the admin can weight the pros & cons, and make the decision right for his organization.A general comment: We moved from SharePoint On-Premises to O365. The On-Premises auditing reports (generated from .../_layouts/15/Reporting.aspx?Category=Auditing ) were sufficient. However, when we moved to O365 we learned that Microsoft has purposely reduced the amount of events that are viewable from these reports. Therefore, I needed to request my SharePoint admin to generate a report from the back-end that sends a daily CSV to me. This report has more events, but comes in a less digestable JSON format. (See:  ). That adds more work for the customer, because we now need to create a new process to make the audit data presentable in our business user reports/dashboards. Furthermore, it's not clear why the .../_layouts/15/Reporting.aspx?Category=Auditing front-end method not have the same options as the back-end reporting method.Thank you.", "author": "886559611", "created_at": "2019-03-01", "votes": 3, "reaction": [], "comments": []}

Can this functionality be developed, so that the DLP can strip RMS from both an Email and Attachment?Kind regards\nClint", "author": "858387331", "created_at": "2018-10-14", "votes": 4, "reaction": [], "comments": []}

When developing daemon based applications that usually require app-only permissions, we are facing a compliance and permission issue for such types of applications.If we take SharePoint Online as an example. If a business unit wants to develop daemon tool between their system and a subset of SharePoint Online sites, this cannot be accomplished without granting them access to all SharePoint assets of the organization. \nLet us assume I am going to build a daemon tool that is allowed to write to SharePoint Online, I am usually getting all or nothing from a permissions point of view. In theory, I could start writing in any SharePoint Online site collection without being limited at all. This might work well for all types of applications that are governed by a centrally located IT. On the other hand, it makes impossible to delegate these types of application developements to different business units in the company.Today, the only ways I see to circumvent this problem is by following on of these approaches:\n- Fallback to the \"classic\" SharePoint development model (add-in development) - We are not only not using the Graph API but we have some other issues like the lack of integration with modern security systems such as conditional access.\n- Create a cloud only identity and an app having delegated permisions. Grant the access to the specific cloud identity on the desired SharePoint sites - Federated identities do not work in this approach even if these are preferred. You have an added complexity with the need of managing a cloud identity. This is not desired in some enterprises.It would be nice to have the possibility to have a modality to configure app-only permissions which should consider the permissions on the target system such as SharePoint Online.
