However, if that's the model, there is functionality not currently part of the board that I feel is very important to making it a useful tool. As a first step, excluding empty boards from suggestions or search results would be great. Because boards are open to everyone across an organization, it would also be great to see trending boards or suggestions for boards when categorizing a document. SharePoint supports @ mentions and # tagging, which is functionality that I feel would strongly improve the \"board\" concept and the functionality of Delve. Having a board is great, but if I can't see what boards my colleagues are contributing to, then it makes it much harder to find natural collaboration or discover related content.There is also an issue with the search results, as when you search for a board name the search engine does not return documents tagged/added to that board. For example, I have a pdf that I have tagged to a \"Corporate\" board, but the word \"Corporate\" does not appear in the document. When I search in Delve for the term \"Corporate\" this document is not in the results. To me, if a board is going to be a functional tag then it absoutely has to show up in search results as metadata associated with the document. Documents I have added to the board should not only show up in search results, but they should have a higher priority than others. Based on this behavior, it appears that the search functionality does not index the board names/tag. This functionality is clearly available in SharePoint and should aboslutely be implemented in Delve. "}, {"author": "61364789", "created_at": "2016-02-10", "text": "Hi. I am a program manager working with boards in Delve. The underlying issue here is that a board i really a collection of documents that share the same tag. If you think of a board as \"show me all items tagged 'LasVegasConference' that I have access to\" then it follows that the way to make sure there are no documents on a board is to remove/rename the tag on each of the documents shown on a board.  If you no longer want the board to show up for you, what you need to do is to remove it from your favorites. We recently consolidated favorite docs and favorite boards under the star in the left pane, so that is how you can get to all boards you've added docs to or favorited before. \nPerhaps the ask that remains is that you do not want empty boards to show up in suggestions or in search results. This is something we're looking into. Remember though, that if a board looks empty to you, that may be because you happen to not have access to other documents tagged with that board name. \nI would be grateful to hear back as to whether this model of thinking of boards as tags makes more sense to you and helps explain why they behave the way they do today.

What's more is that we're not a coherent team - we more or less act as separate teams.  This has led to communication problems.  One example is that some of us in the US were working to solve the same problem as some of our colleagues in China without even knowing it until much effort had been duplicated.  Something like Delve could fix this.  Here's the idea - the ability to create and publish access to \"custom\" feeds.  For example, we would like the ability to create a \"Global IT Team\" feed and grant access using Active Directory security control.  That way, for example, we could just grant read/write to the feed to one security group and anyone in that group could make new posts and read the posts that are there.  What would be really great is if there could be a Delve client that could largely automate post creation.  I envision this working by right-clicking on the root of a shared project folder that contains a readme file with a specific name and format and an image with a specific name and then clicking \"add to Delve\", then the Delve client would automatically scan the files to create the post and scan the share permissions to automatically determine who will see the post on their feed.  That way, oh - someone is working on this awesome C# application to do XYZ thing and it's not a secret - this can let other people who might be interested in contributing know about it. You're working on a semi-private project? No problem. Access is automatically restricted based on share permissions so if you didn't grant access to someone, it won't ever show up on their Delve feed.I envision the feed posts being much like those of the Edge Browser feed - a single image (optional), a category & tags which are clickable for filtering, and a brief summary.  The title would be hyperlinked to open either the project readme file that contains more info, the entire shared folder, or even an actual web page if one exists for the project.", "author": "368369293", "created_at": "2017-05-04", "votes": 3, "reaction": [], "comments": []}

Also happens on my personal non domain laptop, using my Home O365 subscription. I was at 2013 and it was fine. I upgraded to the newest version (O365 Ver 1808 Build 10730.20102) and it started doing it. Only thing common is Office 365 version 1808 - Builds 10730.20127 & 10730.20102.\nI have done 2 days of troubleshooting, everything from Online Office repairs, reinstalled Office, different mice and user profiles, and it even happen in safe mode. All updates are done and sfc /scannow ran 3 times and the problem still persists. Again, this is occurring on about 10 systems and the only thing in common is Office 365 Ver 1808.\nI contacted O365 Support.

An example would be 'SLACK' (https://slack.com/signin) linkage.", "idea_text": "Implement Technical Networking Tool Association With Leading Providers...  An example would be 'SLACK' () linkage.  Whereas Microsoft beats any other competitor in whatever field it may compete, it sometimes lacks in the operability for developers/coders/programmers to associated with one another through the equivalent of 'social medium' platforms but instead direct to the point.I created a 'Slack' account hoping to group some coders in the States that I know (who work in reputed companies), and 'Slack' is truly amazing with all its bots, 90's-like MIRC operability, and add-ons that Microsoft may not provide due to intellectual copyrights.  And then there is GitHub/Git-Shell, and countless other networking options by professionals (I am not going to list them all because I do not know them all).I just think that Office 365 should have some sort of association with these mediums to further enhance the Microsoft name, in a way making it domineer further, and at the same time encourage diversification and entrepreneurial intellectual incentive.  For example, it would be nice to share a Delve/Sway post directly to a 'Slack' channel room and allow it so all other members can edit the work directly through 'Slack', or indeed include additional tools in the Sway that only Slack may provide.Office 365 could catalogue a 'White Pages Directory' (however online) of all associated 'Slack' groups/channels for view within Office 365 (if consented by the other side/individual), and there is room for partnership and integration between these software companies.That is just one example.

This is very confusing, because the same content card should be displayed 1:1 with the same display template, regardless of what page you're visiting. Now the content cards on board pages are conflicting with home and search pages. At this stage, it really doesn't matter if you want to choose to always display Filename or if you want to choose to always display Title from some metadata, etc etc. But once you do choose something, please use that same display template constantly through whole Delve, all pages.
